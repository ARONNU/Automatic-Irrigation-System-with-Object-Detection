Yes, you can use the `cron` scheduler to execute a script automatically at a specific time of the day. Here's an example code that prints "Hello, world!" every day at 10:30 AM:

1. Create a new Python script:

```
nano hello_world.py
```

2. Add the following code to the file:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

print("Hello, world!")
```

3. Save the file and exit the editor.

4. Make the script executable:

```
chmod +x hello_world.py
```

5. Open the crontab file for editing:

```
crontab -e
```

6. Add the following line to the end of the file to schedule the script to run every day at 10:30 AM:

```
30 10 * * * /path/to/hello_world.py
```

Replace `/path/to/hello_world.py` with the actual path to the script.

7. Save the file and exit the editor.

Now the script will automatically run every day at 10:30 AM. You can modify the schedule by changing the numbers in the cron job line. For example, to run the script every hour, you can use the following line:

```
0 * * * * /path/to/hello_world.py
```

This will run the script at the start of every hour.
